## **üìå What Defines an IPBC System?**  

The **IPBC (InterPlanetary Blockchain)** is not just another blockchain. It represents a **new model of decentralization**, where each user maintains **their own blockchain** and **security rules**, eliminating reliance on miners, validators, or large-scale servers.  

For a system to be considered **IPBC-compliant**, it must adhere to several fundamental principles:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Work Offline, Enabling Transactions and Queries**  
- An IPBC system must allow **transactions between devices without an internet connection**, using **local networks, Bluetooth, or other direct communication methods**.  
- Users should also be able to **access their transaction history** even when offline.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Act as a Local Server in Areas Without Connectivity**  
- Devices running IPBC should be able to function as **decentralized servers** in regions without internet access.  
- This allows for **autonomous marketplaces**, where people can exchange assets without global infrastructure.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Allow Exporting Keys and Blockchain in Accessible Formats**  
- The blockchain and private keys must be **exportable and storable** by the user.  
- Supported formats should include **TXT, CSV, Base64**, or any other widely accepted method, ensuring **full portability**.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Not Depend on Fixed Access Points (URLs or Centralized Servers)**  
- Unlike traditional blockchains, an IPBC system **must not rely on a specific server or fixed URL** to function.  
- It needs to be **autonomous**, allowing any user to connect and participate without intermediaries.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Require Validation of Two Transactions to Publish Your Own**  
- To maintain decentralization, every user must validate **two other transactions** before submitting their own.  
- This eliminates the need for **miners or central validators**, making transactions **faster and cost-effective**.  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Each Asset Equals One Unit in IPBC**  
- IPBC does not have **floating values** like traditional currencies.  
- An asset is always **1 unit** within IPBC. If it represents **one digital dollar, it remains 1 USD**.  
- However, if conversion is needed (e.g., **1 USD ‚â† 1 BRL**), the user must manually **validate or perform the conversion**.  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ No Wasted Computational Power**  
- The IPBC **does not waste computational power** on meaningless calculations.  
- **Hashes are standardized**, ensuring security without excessive energy consumption.  
- **Security** is based on **Proof of Content** and **wallet reserves**, ensuring **safe transactions without resource waste**.
