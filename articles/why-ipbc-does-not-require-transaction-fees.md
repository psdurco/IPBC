# **📌 Why Doesn’t IPBC Require Transaction Fees?**  

Modern cryptocurrencies face a **structural problem**: transaction fees. Whether it's **miners charging fees to validate a block (Bitcoin, Ethereum)** or a **GAS system like Ethereum to prioritize transactions**, there’s always an embedded cost. But is this truly necessary?  

**IPBC eliminates transaction fees** through an innovative model: **collaborative validation**.

## **🔍 The Problem with Fees in Traditional Cryptocurrencies**  

Currently, transaction fees serve three main purposes:  

1️⃣ **Incentivizing validators (miners or stakers)** – In **Bitcoin**, miners need rewards to keep the network running. In **Ethereum**, validators earn fees for processing transactions.  

2️⃣ **Preventing spam on the network** – Charging a small fee prevents users from sending millions of transactions to overload the system.  

3️⃣ **Prioritizing transactions** – In **Ethereum**, paying more GAS ensures that your transaction is processed first.  

The problem? **This creates an exclusive and inefficient system**, where **sending money becomes expensive and impractical for many users**. Additionally, network congestion drastically increases costs, making **micropayments and global accessibility unfeasible**.

## **💡 The IPBC Model: Collaborative Validation Instead of Fees**  

In **IPBC**, transaction fees are unnecessary because **transactions are validated by the users themselves**. Here’s how it works:  

✔️ To **send** a transaction, a user must **validate two transactions from other users**.  
✔️ This ensures that **the network self-organizes without requiring miners or centralized validators**.  
✔️ Since each participant validates two transactions before publishing their own, the network **maintains security and decentralization autonomously**.  

This model solves the **three main issues of transaction fees** without charging users:  
✅ No need to reward miners (since there’s no mining).  
✅ The system self-regulates against spam since each user must validate two transactions before submitting their own.  
✅ No transaction priority issues – all transactions are validated equally.  

This **makes IPBC accessible to anyone**, without needing to pay to use their own blockchain.

## **📡 Who Pays for the Infrastructure?**  

A valid question would be: **if there are no fees, who keeps the system running?**  

The answer is simple: **the users already cover the costs**.  

- Users **already own their smartphones or computers**.  
- Users **already pay for internet access**.  
- Users **already cover electricity and storage costs**.  

Therefore, **there’s no reason to charge for transactions**, as the essential infrastructure **is already maintained by the users themselves**. Unlike traditional blockchains where miners demand fees to justify investments in expensive machines, **IPBC naturally decentralizes this cost**.

## **🌍 The Impact of IPBC on the Future of Cryptocurrencies**  

By eliminating fees, IPBC enables:  

🔹 **Real micropayments** – Small transactions are no longer unfeasible due to high fees.  
🔹 **Global financial inclusion** – Anyone can transact without intermediaries.  
🔹 **Wider blockchain adoption** – Without financial barriers, IPBC can be used for various applications, from **local commerce to humanitarian aid in regions without banking infrastructure**.  
🔹 **Infinite scalability** – The more users join, **the more efficient the network becomes**, as more transactions are being validated in a decentralized manner.  

IPBC **is not just a blockchain without fees**, but rather a **new economic model**, where **every user contributes to the system without needing to pay for it**.
